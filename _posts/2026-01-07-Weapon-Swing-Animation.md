# Introduction to Project Neo

This will be my first article in a series of blog posts about the development of my 2D action RPG game that mixes the visuals and platforming of Starbound, with the RPG elements and loot system of Diablo 2.

My goal for this blog is to document my journey through game development from prototype to a full launch of the game. I will post my thoughts and feelings about different aspects of the development process

# About The Dev

I am a hobbyist developer of roughly 10 years with no experience of releasing games. Like many game developers, I have about 50 unreleased/unfinished games under my belt, and strictly doing this as a hobby with the plan of releasing this game to the public.

At this time, it is being developed as a single player game, focused on the Windows platform. I am working solo on this project. While this is my first blog post about the project, Project Neo (development title) was created in late 2025. I do not plan on creating tutorials, however, I will be posting code snippets in articles. I highly recommend you check out Adam C Younis on Youtube if you want some high quality tutorials for 2D game development.

I do not plan to do any advertising or streaming of the game during its early development phase, however, this may be something I’ll visit if the project gets to that point

# The Project (Neo)
## Elevator Pitch
Project Neo is a 2D action RPG platformer being developed for the Windows platform in Unity that unions the look and feel of Chucklefish’s Starbound’s beautiful art style and its crisp platforming controls, with the community acclaimed loot system and RPG elements of Blizzard’s Diablo 2.
The Engine
For the engine, I am using Unity 6000.3 (colloquially known as Unity 6.3). The IDE is Jetbrain’s Rider.

## AI
I will be utilizing Github Copilot for this project as well. At this time, the use of AI & LLMs in game development can be a divisive topic (which I may go into in another blog post), however I have felt that it has helped me stay dedicated to the project and overcoming hurdles that have grounded me in many projects before. I will ***not*** be using AI for any generative processes such as art, audio or dialogue, and will strictly be used for coding purposes.
Art
For the art, I am using Aesprite with a Wacom Intuos tablet. The art design is strongly inspired by Starbound, a game by Chucklefish. I really enjoy the aesthetic of this game and have enjoyed using it as a way to expand my artistic skills. I also had Terraria, a game developed by Re-Logic, as an inspiration, however I felt Starbound’s more detailed approach was something that would fit the feel of this game better.

## Gameplay
For the platforming, I am heavily inspired by both Starbound and Terraria as they both handle platforming in a very similar fashion. I am aiming for crisp platforming controls with satisfying combat elements. I do not plan to implement terraforming that Terraria is well known for, however, I am not completely opposed to it, if it makes sense to implement in the future.

While the look and feel of the platforming will be similar to Starbound, the back end of the RPG and combat will be heavily inspired by Diablo 2, a gaming icon made by Blizzard North. The loot system will follow Diablo 2’s iconic loot generation system, including uniques, sets, rune words, jewels and gems. The combat skills and classes will also follow Diablo 2 as closely as possible during at least the prototyping stage. The stats and RPG elements will also closely mimic Diablo 2’s system.

## Influences
### Chucklefish
Developer of [Starbound](https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/). Also, publishers of other well known games such as [Risk of Rain](https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain_2013/), and [Stardew Valley](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/). There will be an immediate recognition of the art style used in Starbound.

### Blizzard (North)
Developer of [Diablo 2](https://diablo2.blizzard.com/en-us/). While the Blizzard North team is now defunct, there is still a sizable cult following for its former team members like David Brevik. Diablo 2 (and to a slightly lesser extent, Diablo 1 on the PSX) was a huge part of my childhood, so I understand it’s systems quite deeply and extensively

### Grinding Gear Games
Developer of [Path of Exile](https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/), and [Path of Exile 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/). Grinding Gear Games (or more widely known as GGG), have not only reawakened the Diablo 2’s loot system, it has even expanded upon it and fleshed it out even further. While I don’t plan to utilize the loot system of PoE (I don’t want to have to deal with loot filters), I have a couple thousand hours in PoE 1 in which I can use as an influence to what makes loot good and bad.

### Re-Logic
Developer of [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/). Another game that I have poured hundreds of hours into that influenced me to make this project a 2D side scroller platformer with combat elements. While the game itself is a gem, the true shining diamond that is Terraria, is Re-Logic’s commitment to releasing free, significant and sizable updates to the game over its nearly 15 years since release.

### [Adam C Younis](https://www.youtube.com/@AdamCYounis)
Developer of [Insignia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127370/Insignia/). I have been following Adam on YouTube for many years and have utilized many of his tutorials over the years. I highly recommend his channel if you're looking for high quality game development tutorials.

### [Game Makers Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK)
Developer of [Mind over Magnet](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2685900/Mind_Over_Magnet/), and [Word Play](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3586660/Word_Play/). Mark has an extensible amount of content for any kind of game developer. His "Developing 101" series was a significant influence on me to get out of tutorial hell and begin work on a passion project. This series will also be a guidance if, and when the project reaches a release-worthy status

## In Closing
Hopefully this wasn’t too much of a slog to get through, and I hope I have painted a picture for you of what my vision is for this project. Future posts should be more bite-sized content, to act as updates and a time-capsule.
